        <p>This page is used to inform visitors of my policies regarding the collection, use and disclosure of personal
            information if someone decides to use my service.</p>
        <p>If you wish to use my services, then you can obtain the collection and use of information in connection with
            this
            policy. The personal information I collect is used to provide and improve the service.
            I do not use or share my information with anyone, except in the cases described in this privacy policy.</p>
        <h2>Collection and use of personal data</h2>
        <p>For a better experience, when using my services, I may need some of your personal information. The
            information I
            request will be saved on your device and will never be collected.</p>
        <p>For all my products, I agree to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Do not collect any personal data that identifies you</li>
            <li>Do not collect any digital data in case the service needs to have access to your file system</li>
            <li>Do not sell your personal data</li>
            <li>Do not use your personal information for commercial purposes such as advertising</li>
            <li>Protect accidentally shared data</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Security</h2>
        <p>I appreciate your trust in me to promote your personal information, which is why I strive to use commercially
            acceptable means to protect it. But remember which method of transmission over the Internet or method of
            electronic storage is not 100% secure and reliable, and I cannot guarantee absolute security.</p>
        <h2>Children's privacy</h2>
        <p>This service is not intended for anyone under the age of 13. I do not knowingly collect personally
            identifiable
            information from children under the age of 13. In the event that I discover that a child under the age of 13
            has
            provided me with personal information, I immediately delete it from my servers. If you are a parent or
            guardian
            and you know that your child has provided us with personal information, please contact me so that I can do
            the
            necessary.
        </p>
        <h2>Modification of this privacy policy</h2>
        <p>I can update this privacy policy at any time, in which case you will be notified of said change.</p>
